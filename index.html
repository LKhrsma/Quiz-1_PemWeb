            <p>Other sources about Rembang can be taken from a manuscript by Mbah Guru. Mentioned among others: "... about saka year 1336 there were campa Banjarmlati people numbering eight families who were good at making cane sugar when they were in their country..."The people had moved to make the unbreakable brown sugar. It departed through the ocean westward until it landed around a river whose edge and right and left grew irregularly mangrove trees. His move was led by Pow's grandfather Ie Din; after landing then praying and praying, then he started cutting down the mangrove tree which was then passed on by the rest of the people.</p>
            <p>The field was then made moor and the yards and housing which later became the village were called kampung: KABONGAN; taking the word from the name of the mangrove tree, became Ka-bonga-an (Kabongan),.... One day at dawn dawned in the month of Waisaka; people will start to grow (mbabat,Ind: prune) sugarcane. Before the start of the mbabat, a sacred ceremony of Sembayang and semadi was held at the place of cognate sugarcane which would be cut by two trees, for the sugarcane "Penganten". The presbytery ceremony was called "ngRembang", until it was used as the name of Rembang City until now. "According to Mbah Guru, the ngRembang sakawit ceremony was held on Legi Wednesday, when the Song of Songs was sung, Kasadha Sunday. The Month of Waisaka, Saka Year 1337 with Candra Sengkala: The Three Wedhas of Isyara.</p>
